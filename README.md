This is a list of (Fuzzy) Data Matching software. The software in this list is
open source and/or freely available.

The term data matching is used to indicate the procedure of bringing together
information from two or more records that are believed to belong to the same
entity. Data matching has two applications: (1) to match data across multiple
datasets (linkage) and (2) to match data within a dataset (deduplication).
See the [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_linkage) about
data matching for more information.

*Similar terms:* record linkage, data matching, deduplication, fuzzy matching,
    entity resolution
