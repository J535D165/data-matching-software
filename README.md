# Data Matching software

This is a list of (Fuzzy) Data Matching software. The software in this list is open source and/or freely available.

The term data matching is used to indicate the procedure of bringing together information from two or more records that are believed to belong to the same entity. Data matching has two applications: (1) to match data across multiple datasets and (2) to match data within a dataset. See the [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_linkage) about data matching for more information. 

*Similar terms:* record linkage, data matching, deduplication, fuzzy matching, entity resolution

- [Dedupe](https://github.com/dedupeio/dedupe) - Dedupe is a python library for fuzzy matching, deduplication and entity resolution on structured data. The library makes use of active learning to match record pairs. Active learning is useful in cases without training data. Dedupe has a side-product for deduplicating CSV files, [csvdedupe](https://github.com/dedupeio/csvdedupe), through the command line. Dedupeio also offers commercial products for data matching.
