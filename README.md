This is a list of (Fuzzy) Data Matching software. The software in this list is
FOSS (Free and open-source software).

The term data matching is used to indicate the procedure of bringing together
information from two or more records that are believed to belong to the same
entity. Data matching has two applications: (1) to match data across multiple
datasets (linkage) and (2) to match data within a dataset (deduplication).
See the [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_linkage) about
data matching for more information.

*Similar terms:* record linkage, data matching, deduplication, fuzzy matching,
    entity resolution

linkage. Initially developed in 2013 to serve as a linkage tool supporting a joint 
Brazilâ€“U.K. project aiming at building a large population-based cohort with data 
from more than 100 million participants and producing disease-specific data to facilitate 
diverse epidemiological research studies.

#### [Zingg](https://github.com/zinggAI/zingg)

[Zingg](https://zingg.ai) is an open-source ML based tool for entity resolution with which analytics engineer and the data scientist can quickly integrate data silos and build unified views at scale. Zingg has the ability to connect to disparate data source, local and cloud file systems in any format, enterprise applications and relational, NoSQL and cloud databases and warehouses. It scales to large volume of data and you can define domain specific functions to improve matching.
Not only Zingg support English as well as Chinese, Thai, Japanese, Hindi and other languages, it also has a very active [slack community](https://join.slack.com/t/zinggai/shared_invite/zt-w7zlcnol-vEuqU9m~Q56kLLUVxRgpOA) where people around the globe come and help and share their views.

#### [dirty-cat](https://github.com/dirty-cat/dirty_cat)

[dirty-cat](https://dirty-cat.github.io/) is an open-source Python package that facilitates machine-learning with with dirty data: robust to morphological variants, such as typos. Some of the currently supported features are: fuzzy joining tables on dirty numerical, string or mixed type columns, deduplicating and encoding dirty categorical variables for ML. [This example](https://dirty-cat.github.io/stable/auto_examples/01_dirty_categories.html) illustrates why to use dirty-cat encoders rather than OneHotEncoder on dirty data and [this one](https://dirty-cat.github.io/stable/auto_examples/04_fuzzy_joining_and_FeatureAugmenter.html) shows how to join multiple dirty tables for ML.
The transfomers ([TableVectorizer](https://dirty-cat.github.io/stable/generated/dirty_cat.TableVectorizer.html), [FeatureAugmenter](https://dirty-cat.github.io/stable/generated/dirty_cat.FeatureAugmenter.html)) are scikit-learn compatible, and easily introduced into ML pipelines.
